Math 40 - Chapter 1


Section 1.1

Remember that in algebra we almost always symbolize division with a fraction bar, not a divided-by sign "÷", not a slash "/". 
Please never use the "x" for multiplication. I might very well deduct points for that.

* Remember: We will not be using the internet to submit assignments. 
Instead we will discuss the homework at our face-to-face class meetings and take a paper-and-pencil quiz afterward. 
You may think of the quizzes as the part of the homework that you turn in.

Section 1.2

Improper fractions and mixed ::ahem::  NUMERALS. (please don't call them mixed NUMBERS no matter what the text does.)

* Please note that we rarely use mixed numerals in algebra. Just about the only time we use mixed numerals is when we must pay close attention to the order of several numbers, as on a number line.


*************************************************************************************************************************************


Section 1.3

* Our text calls {1, 2, 3,...} the set of Natural Numbers. Some people reserve that phrase for the set {0, 1, 2, 3,...} (starting with 0 instead of with 1). 
This minor disagreement in terminology will not affect us because I will refer to the set {0, 1, 2, 3,...} as the whole numbers.
* There are commonly-used symbols for the special sets of numbers that we will study in this course. These are
     
ℕℕ = the set of natural numbers (see the warning above)
ℤℤ = the set of integers
ℚℚ = the set of rational numbers
ℝℝ = the set of real numbers

An example of a nonreal number is √−1, which you will learn about in Intermediate Algebra.

It is important to know that we can always express real numbers as decimals, possibly as infinite, non-repeating decimals. 
For example, √2 = 1.4142135... (never repeating), and π = 3.1415926... (never repeating).

* Please note that it is very important for us to know that a real number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion is repeating. 
A terminating decimal counts as repeating because we can "pad it out" with copies of the digit zero ("0"). 
Another word for "repeating" is "periodic" because we call the repeating block of digits the "period".
* We aren't yet responsible for the following properties explicitly, but knowing them is helpful:

• Between any two distinct real numbers there are infinitely many rational numbers and infinitely many irrational numbers.

• The real numbers have nice algebraic properties that we will study soon: Associative, Commutative, and Distributive Properties.

Section 1.4

As you read the narrative in this section, look for the words and phrases "additive inverse", "additive identity element","associative property", and "commutative property". 
If you must abbreviate, please use five letters to abbreviate "associative", i.e., abbreviate it as "assoc." 
Also, get in the habit of writing the properties' full names: Associative Property of Addition, etc. It's not enough just to write "Associative".

Examples of Naming Properties
The text does not give many examples on naming properties, so here are a few: 
In each, name the property that justifies each step. 
Hint: At each step, focus just on what changed, not on what stayed the same.


1.) 10 + (5 + x)
     = 10 + (x + 5) (Commutative property of addition - applied to the x and the 5 in the parentheses)
     = (x + 5) + 10 (Commutative property of addition - applied to the 10 and the whole quantity “(x + 5)”)
     = x + (5 + 10) (Associative property of addition) 
     = x + 15 (“Substitution property of equality” —we’re not responsible for this one. We substituted 15 for the “(5 + 10)”.)


 2.) (-7 + a) + (-12)
   = [(a + (-7)) + (-12)] (Commutative property of addition - applied to the “a” and the “-7” inside the parentheses)
   = [a + (-7 + (-12))] (Associative property of addition) 
   = [a + (-19)] (Substitution, again, not required) 
   = [a - 19] (This is the new definition of subtraction: addition of the opposite.) 
   
   
Be sure to name the property and the operation! 
That is, don’t just write “associativity”; write “associativity of addition”. 
Here are some hints on identifying properties. 
If only the grouping symbols moved but not the quantities, then you used associativity. 
If only the quantities moved, but not the grouping symbols, then you probably used commutativity. 


*************************************************************************************************************************************


Section 1.5

* We are also responsible for such two-word phrases as "less than", "smaller than", and "shorter than". 
Unlike "minus" and "decreased by", these phrases reverse the order of the quantities they are between.

Example: 
"7 less than –18" means "–18 – 7", or –25. 
It's the same as "–18 minus 7" or "-18 decreased by 7". 
Pay attention to the order of the quantities! 


Additional Exercises:
In each, symbolize and evaluate the expression. 
1.) 14 less than 50
2.) 14 less than -50
3.) 11 decreased by 35
4.) -11 decreased by 35
5.) 27 minus 100
6.) -27 minus 100
7.) 14 (⅓) less than 9.5, and write the answer as an improper fraction.
8.) 14 (⅓) less than -9.5, and write the answer as an improper fraction.


Convert decimals in fractions:
- -9.5 to Fraction...
- (-9.5/1) * (10/10) = (-95/10) 
- Reduce the fraction... 
- (-95/10) / (5/5) = (-19/2)
- Note: 5 is the highest divisible number of both the numerator and the denominator.


Putative Answers
1.) 50 - 14 = 36
2.) -50 - 14 = -64
3.) 11 - 35 = -24
4.) -11 - 35 = -46
5.) 27 - 100 = -73
6.) -27 - 100 = -127
7.) 9.5 - 14 (⅓) = (19/2) - (43/3) = (-29/6)
8.) 9.5 - 14 (⅓) = (19/2) - (43/3) = (-29/6)
9.) -9.5 - 14 (⅓) = (-19/2) - (43/3) = (-143/6)


*************************************************************************************************************************************


Section 1.6

In each, name the property that justifies each step. 
Hint: At each step, focus just on what changed, not on what stayed the same.

1.) 
10 + 7(5 + x)
 = [10 + 7(x + 5)] (Commutative property of addition) 
 = [10 + (7x + 35)] (Distributive property - of multiplication over addition.)
 = [(7x + 35) + 10] (Commutative property of addition) 
 = [7x + (35 + 10)] (Associative property of addition) 
 = [7x + 45] (“Substitution” —we’re not responsible for naming this property)


2.) 
(2x)(4) + 12x
= [(4)(2x) + 12x] (Commutative property of multiplication) 
= [(4 * 2)x + 12x] (Associative property of multiplication) 
= [8x + 12x] (Substitution, again, not required of you) 
= [(8 + 12)x] (Distributive property of multiplication over addition “in reverse”)
= [20x] (Substitution again)


Be sure to name the property and the operation! That is, don’t just write “associativity”; write “associativity of addition”. 
Here are some hints on identifying properties:
If only the grouping symbols moved but not the quantities, then you used associativity. 
If only the quantities moved but not the grouping symbols, then you probably used commutativity. But be careful; sometimes it’s distributivity.

Section 1.7


Learn this alternative notation for exponentiation: 
We sometimes use “x^n” (with an explicit operation symbol ^) to indicate “x to the nth power”, i.e., (x^n), 
especially when keyboarding and we don’t feel like dealing with the math palette. 
Some of you may already be familiar with that notation from a computer class. 
Another equivalent notation is “x**n” but it’s gone out of fashion. (Are any of you old enough to remember Fortran?)

Memorize the Order of Operations:
Some of you might have been taught the mnemonic PEMDAS or "Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally" for the Order of Operations. 
Please forget it!! It is misleading and yields incorrect answers for which I will not give you partial credit.


First: Parentheses and Brackets
Next: Exponents
Then: Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
Last: Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

Section 1.9

Finding an opposite by distributing an implied "-1")...
Please note that if the instructions ask you to identify this operation, you must call it "opposite" or "negation". Do not call it "multiplication".

Chapter 1: Negation, Order of Operations and Absolute Values

Intro
In this supplemental section, we expand on some topics that don't get sufficient attention in our text: the relationship among negation, absolute value, and the Order of Operations.

Negation and the Order of Operations
The operation of taking an opposite is called negation. Note that negating a negative number has a positive result. 
For example, –(–9)=9. Other examples: –(–4)=4, –(9)=–9, –(π)=–π, –(–π)=π, and –(0)=0.
Recall that negating a number has exactly the same effect as multiplying by –1. 
For this reason, negation has the same priority in the Order of Operations as multiplication. 
In particular, negation comes after exponentiation.

Absolute Values and the Order of Operations
Absolute value bars are treated like a matched pair of grouping symbols. 
Thus: 
(1) We perform operations inside of a matched pair of absolute value bars before we take the absolute value itself. 
(2) We must take an absolute value before we perform any operations immediately outside the bars. (Of course, once we have performed those operations, the bars are gone.) 
Recall also that another word for the result of taking an absolute value is magnitude. Thus, the magnitude of –1.414 is 1.414.
