Section 3.4 

Please note that for vertical lines or line segments, we always answer something like "no slope" or "undefined slope". 
Do not write zero. 
Do not write "n/a" or "∅". 
Do not answer "infinite" or "infinity" or "∞". 
Do not use the empty-set symbol; slopes are not sets.

What if we want to graph Y = -2?
Where's X? If the X isn’t there, then it can be anything! 
And y is locked in at -2.
So, what would this look like?
It's a horizontal line! Straight across and it can be anything!

So, what’s the slope of this line? Grab two points and see?
M = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) = [-2 - (-2)] / [-1 - 0] = (0/1) = 0
The slope of a horizontal line is 0! 

It can be hard to remember when the line on the graph is horizontal or vertical. 
Remember that when you see Y = -2, Y is always -2 and X can be anything! 
This might help you tell what the graph should look like. 

“Uphill” : Positive Slope : Line on graph looks like /
“Downhill” : Negative Slope : Line on graph looks like \
Horizontal : Slope = 0 : Line on graph looks like —
Vertical : Slope is Undefined : Line on graph looks like |

Slope of a Line
M = Rise / Run = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)
M = Slope
(X1, Y1) = Coordinates of first point in the line
(X2, Y2) = Coordinates of second point in the line

**************************************************

Slope of the line


Graph: -2x + y = -1 —> y = 2x -1;
x  |  y
0   -1
1    1
2    3
3    5

(Rise / Run) =  (Change Y by 2 / Change X by 1) = (2/1);
Slope = (2/1);


Graph: y = -(3/2)x + 2
x  |  y
0    2
2   -1
4   -4

Slope = -(3/2);
 

Note: If you isolate y, you get the slope of the line from the value of x. 

y = 2x - 1
Slope = 2 = 2/1 = rise/run
y-intercept = -1

**************************************************

Find the slope of a line with two points


Points: (1,1) and (5,3);
M = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1);
M = (3-1) / (5-1);
M = (2/4);

Find The Slope of The Line Through (-1,3), (-3,5):
M = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1);
M = (5-3) / (-3+1)
M  = (2 / -2)
M = -1

Additional Exercises

(This exercise is an excuse to practice your fraction skills.) 
Find the slope-intercept and general ("Ax+By=C") forms for the equation of the line whose x-intercept 
is where x=-3/2 and whose y-intercept is where y=–27/4.

Putative Answers

The slope-intercept form is: 𝑦 = −3/2𝑥 − 27/4...
There are many general forms. One is 18x + 4y = -27.

Slope - Intercept Form of a Line

Ex: 2x + 3y = 6;
Isolate y: 2x + 3y = 6 —> 3y = 6 - 2x —> y = 2 - (⅔)x —> y = (⅔)x + 2;
M = Slope = (-⅔);
Y-Intercept = 2;
Slope-Intercept Form: Y = Mx + B;

**************************************************

Identify The Slope and Y-Intercept

Y = (X/4) - 2
Y = Mx + B
Y = (¼)x - 2
M = (¼)

Graphing Lines using Slope, Y-Intercept

Graph: -2x + y = -3;
Slope Intercept Form: Y = Mx + B: y = 2x - 3;
M = Slope: 2;
B = Y-Intercept: -3;  

**************************************************

Graph: 2x + 3y = 6;
Slope Intercept Form: Y = Mx + B: y = (-⅔)x + 2;
M = Slope: (-⅔);

**************************************************

Finding the Slope Intercept Form of the Equation of the Line

Ex. Find the slope-intercept form of the line. 
2x + 3y = 24 —> y = Mx + B —> y = (-⅔)x + (8);

**************************************************

Ex. Is (6,4) on the line y = (-⅔)x + 8?
4 = (-⅔)(6) + 8
4 = -4 + 8
4 = 4;
YES!

**************************************************

Ex. Find b such that (-3,2) is on the line y = 2x +B.
-2 = 2(3) + B
-2 = 6 + B
B = -8;

Y = 2x - 8;

**************************************************

Find the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line through the points (-1,2), (3,8). 
Y = Mx + B
Slope = M = (Y2 -Y1) / (X2 -X1) = (8-2) / (3+1) = (6/4) = (3/2);
Y = (3/2)x + B
2 = (3/2)(-1) + b
[2 = (-3/2) + b](2)
4 = -3 + 2b
7 = 2b
b = (7/2)
 
Y = (3/2)x + (7/2);

In #1 and 2, symbolize as a system in two variables and then solve by graphing.
1.) The sum of two unknown numbers is 1. The second number is three less than the first.
2.) Half of one unknown number decreased by a second number yields 2. The first number is four more than twice the second. 
3.) It is important to know that not all graphs are lines. The Application exercises illustrate this to some extent. 
Here’s another. Solve this system by graphing: { y = (x^2); y = x + 2; }

1.)
Answer: System { x + y = 1; y = x - 3; Solution set: {(2, -1)}; }
2.)
Answer: System { (½)x - y = 2; x = 2y + 4; There are infinitely many solutions because the two equations have the same graph; } 
3.)   
y = (x^2); 
y = x + 2;
Answer: {(-1,1),(2,4)}
