Math 40 - Chapter 3


Section 3.1

* Please notice that a point's coordinates may be any real numbers, not just integers.
* Notice also that I do not capitalize the c in "cartesian".  
My teachers taught me to capitalize people's names but not adjectives derived from those names.
* Here's a pseudo-mnemonic for remembering the coordinates of the origin: 
The ordered pair (0,0) looks like an owl's face, so think of it as the original owl. 
(Tip o' th' pencil to my colleague Ms. Lockman)

Note:
- Coordinates : Points : Ordered Pairs

Additional Exercises
Determine whether the ordered pairs are solutions of the equation.
1.) Equation: (-x^2)(y) = 12; 
Ordered Pairs: a.) (-2,-3); b.) (1, -12); c.) (-1, 12);
2.) Equation: (2x^3) + (3y^2) = x + 11; 
Ordered Pairs: a.) (1, -1); b.) (-1, -2);

1a.) -(-2)^2(-3) = -(4)(-3) = -4(-3) = 12; (Yes)
1b.) -(1)^2(-12) = -(1)(-12) = -1(-12) = 12; (Yes)
1c.) -(-1)^2(12) = -(1)(12) = -1(12) = -12; (No)

2a.) 
2(1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 = 1 + 11  
2(1) + 3(-1) = 12 
2 - 3 = 12  
-1 = 12; (No)

2b.) 
2(-1)^3 + 3(-2)^2 = -1 + 11   
2(-1) + 3(4) = 10 
-2 + 12 = 10   
10 = 10; (Yes)

Section 3.3

* Please note that I will require you to report intercepts as ORDERED PAIRS, not just as numbers. 
Thus, in your final answers your x-intercepts should look like (a,0) 
for some number a and your y-intercepts should look like (0,b) for some number b.
